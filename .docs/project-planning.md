# Braydon Olinger's Capstone - EsportSync

### I want to build an application that is a communal spot for all esports fans to be able to source information, specifically when their favorite team is playing.

### Another use case would be for teams (semi-professional or high school/collegiate) to share the calendar within their league or with other teams for reschedules.

## Intended Audience
### The audience using my application would be:
- General Esports Fans
- Esports Professionals
- Esports Management & Staff

## Page 1
#### On the "Home Page" would be the main calendar with toggle-able esports titles (League of Legends, Counter-Strike 2, Call of Duty, Halo, etc.)

#### Within the calendar will be labels for each game with the game logo, name of the tournament, and a clickable option on the title to the link of where the stream for the tournament will be (if available).

#### Above the calendar will be a header for all the other pages, as well as a login/register option in the top right. In the top left will be the application logo, which if clicked will always re-route to the homepage.

## Page 2
#### The next page will be an "About Me" section where I give a brief overview of my life, experience in esports, and reason for creating the application. I will supply links to my personal social medias, github and ways to support the application.

## Page 3
#### The Contact Us page will have a form submission option that will allow them to pick from various options of why they'd like to contact us, and a text field to enter a brief description.

## Page 4
#### This page will be another field submission option, but this one will be focused on if teams, colleges, or organizations would like their own personalized calendar, in which I would provide them.

# Purpose & Solution
#### The sole reason for my application will be to centralize all esports tournament/match times and stream locations. This will serve as an efficient option for casual fans, management, players, and anyone else searching for this information.

# Attributes
### Color Palette: #1f0f53 (Royal Purple) - #FFDB99 (Sand yellow) - #000000 (Black) - #ffffff (White)

### Images: [Application Logo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M4TFH7Yrdhh17MeLcRk-9862kFj1qLIj/view?usp=sharing)

### Fonts: Hanken Grotesk & Gurajada

### Navigation: The main source of navigation will be at the header at the top of the page. Within the calendar, the individual events will be clickable and expandable with hyperlinks to the channel (Twitch, YouTube, etc) where the tournament/matches will be streamed.

## Applications Researched:
- [Esports Insider](https://esportsinsider.com/2024/04/esports-events-calendar-2024)
#### I like that it's plain and simple, easy to find the information that you want. I do not like that it's a top -> bottom calendar, versus a traditional calendar style.
- [Esports Charts](https://escharts.com/upcoming-tournaments)
#### I love that this application has some filter-ability, however most of the preferred ones are pay-walled, and it's also a top-bottom calendar approach. This also has a lot of niche titles that seems to be taking a lot of space and almost ruining the calendar entirely.
- [MetaNews.com](https://metanews.com/esports-calendar/)
#### This is MUCH more organized than the other few and I very much appreciate that. There are also hyperlinks included to the tournament page & only the necessary information is forward facing. I do not like that it again isn't the traditional calendar approach, and that there is zero filtration and again, flooded with random niche events.

### How my application will be different:
#### Within my application, my navigation will be much more simple and UI friendly with a native calendar approach. Filtration will be a *HIGH* priority and there will also be color coding options for various titles. I will reduce the titles featured to the Top 10 viewed esports titles to clear out some of the clutter, as well as provide hyperlinks to the tournament pages & streaming channels.
